# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
EDA is the very first step before you can perform any changes to the dataset or develop a statistical model to answer business problems. In other words, the process of EDA contains summarizing, visualizing and getting deeply acquainted with the important traits of a data set.

Typically, using EDA we try to get the answer to the following questions:

- What kind of data is this? (file format, volume of data, number of columns, metadata data of image/video/audio or some feedback in English or other languages, or tabular data, etc)

- How complex is this data? (How many files are there? primary key? how these files are connected to each other? is nested data in some files? is some field having nested data, etc.)

- Is this data sufficient for meeting our ultimate goal, i.e. Model building?

- Is there any missing data? Data needed but not given by the business or not available at all or costly to get that data etc.

- Are there any missing values? In the given dataset do we have complete information or some values are missing for some records or some columns?

- Is there any relationship between different independent variables of the dataset? If yes then how strong is that relationship?

- Are observations independent or tightly coupled?
